Earth

Landsat imagery is provided to the public as a joint project between NASA and USGS.
A recent industry report on landsat satellite imagery data estimates that total annual
value to the economy of $2.19 billion, far exceeding the multi-year total cost of building, launching,
and managing Landsat satellites and sensors. The value is derived from consumers use of the data.
The objective of this endpoint is to give you an easy to use taste of what Landsat imagery data can provide.
There are more complicated APIs available if you want to build models on top of satellite imagery,
apply machine-learning, or minimize clouds in your image. NASA's Earth Science Devision
has a variety of Earth imagery APIs for developers, which you can find out about in the Earthdata Developer Portal.
Specifically, the GIBS (Global Imagery Browse Services) API may be of interest.
The Google Earth Engine API is another powerful option.
This API is powered by Google Earth Engine API, and currently only supports pan-sharpened Landsat 8 imagery.
Query Parameters
Parameter 	Type 	    Default 	Description
lat	        float	    n/a	        Latitude
lon	        float	    n/a	        Longitude
dim	        float	    0.025	    width and height of image in degrees
date	    YYYY-MM-DD	today	    date of image; if not supplied,
                                    then the most recent image (i.e., closest to today) is returned
cloud_score	bool	    False	    [NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE!!!!]
                                    calculate the percentage of the image covered by clouds
api_key	    string	    DEMO_KEY	api.nasa.gov key for expanded usage
Example query

https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/earth/imagery?lon=100.75&lat=1.5&date=2014-02-01&api_key=DEMO_KEY
Note that the returned object may not match the supplied date exactly.
Instead, the image closest to the supplied date is returned.

Assets

This endpoint retrieves the date-times and asset names for closest available imagery for a supplied location and date.
The satellite passes over each point on earth roughly once every sixteen days.
This is an amazing visualization of the acquisition pattern for Landsat 8 imagery.
The objective of this endpoint is primarily to support the use of the imagery endpoint.
